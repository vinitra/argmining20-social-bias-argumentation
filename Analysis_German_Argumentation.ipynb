       "{22: \"young people should go to university or not persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university\\n regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment\\n this essay, i analyze both views first order to come up with a fool-proof decision\\n to begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons\\n from their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are short supply\\n what is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying\\n this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming\\n however, on the other side of the coin are voices the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine\\n these academic values are necessary to the progress of the world\\n more importantly, many researches the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society\\n another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships\\n to sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, i agree with the latter view\\n although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning universities are the vital factor creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges\\n\",\n",
       " 36: 'gun control gun is definitely not a kind of normal good our society, which is strictly controlled most countries\\n however, gun control some countries is relatively loose than others\\n therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world\\n from my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control\\n the first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns\\n the accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns\\n for example, we hear some news from time to time that someone hurt by accident during the hunting\\n the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates\\n secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially some countries where guns are available for people\\n eventually, guns create a violent society if the trend continues\\n take example, american, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting\\n what is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live danger\\n thirdly, the possession of guns can raise the rates of suicide\\n the us, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about per cent\\n unfortunately, there is increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age and over\\n conclusion, considering the rise accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, i support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence\\n',\n",
       " 220: \"learning to be independent is essential for young adults learning to be independent is essential for young adults\\n however, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue\\n my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult\\n my opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents\\n first of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents\\n the young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom the early age\\n when having a job, it is of low possibilities to work his hometown\\n if he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together\\n all memories become priceless treasure as time passes by\\n thus, i think undergoing with parents is worthwhile\\n furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside\\n learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home\\n therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents\\n moreover, another daily expense is the considerable outgoings\\n spending much money may not result what the parents expect their children to be\\n a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer\\n the third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions\\n when dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand\\n they are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way\\n if the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain\\n hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily\\n to sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents\\n hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice\\n\",\n",
       " 234: 'students should be required to take regular standardized tests the issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams\\n this issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it\\n however, i believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge\\n firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students\\n for example some students are not active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue\\n therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students\\n addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them\\n additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice\\n since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, they never try to solve problems on their own\\n however, standardized tests offer them such chance\\n thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides\\n finally, i think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students\\n any class there be students who show low academic performance, teachers could work with them more intensively\\n i support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them\\n ultimately i feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right\\n i belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving appropriate education to their students\\n',\n",

       " 198: 'improve roads or public transports many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation\\n my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating\\n first, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation\\n cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource\\n therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline this world is used up\\n the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person be much lower\\n and this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline\\n second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems\\n averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars\\n it means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes\\n last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation\\n according to national safety council, riding the bus is over times safer than private care\\n thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting\\n short, i can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in\\n',\n",
